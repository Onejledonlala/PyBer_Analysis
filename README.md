### Overview of the analysis
This analysis shows the relationship of ride fares in city types/regions over a period of time.

### Results
The first analysis shows the each regions, its fares, total drivers, average ride per ride and driver in each regions.

On the second analysis, the plot shows the fare in the *rural, urban and suburban* region from *01 Jan to 29 Apr*.

### Summary 
#### Recommendations
- Based on the first analysis, there should be more drivers in the rural region, as the average fare per ride and driver is $34.62 and $55.49 respectively.
- Based on the second analysis, the trend shows higher fares are in the urban region and that should be maintain to yield higher profits compared to the other regions/city types.
- Based on the overall analysis, the suburban region seems to give a normal and low risk profit accumulation based on the relationship between the number of its drivers, fares and rides.
